\paragraph{Remit and organisation.}

In the context of an on-going effort to standardise cryptographic ISEs for
RISC-V, this paper investigates support for AES.
In specific terms, our contributions are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}

\item In 
      \REFSEC{sec:bg}
      we capture some background, including a limited
      Systematisation of Knowledge (SoK)
      for AES ISEs.

\item In 
      \REFSEC{sec:ise}
      we implement and evaluate five different ISEs for AES on two different 
      RISC-V CPU cores.
      We explore existing ISE designs, 
      and introduce what is, to the best of our knowledge, a novel ISE design
      in  \REFSEC{sec:ise:design:v5}
      that uses a quadrant-packed state representation.

\item In
      \REFSEC{sec:gcm}
      we evaluate how the
      proposed standard 
      bit-manipulation
      extension~\cite[Section 21]{RV:ISA:I:19}
      to RISC-V can be used to efficiently implement AES-GCM.

\end{enumerate}

\noindent
On the one hand, 
RISC-V represents an excellent target for such work:
the ISA is extensible by design and its open nature makes
exploration of extensions easier through the availability of
(often open-source) implementations.  
Increased commercial deployment of such implementations suggests that work 
on RISC-V is timely and potentially of high impact.
On the other hand, RISC-V also presents unique challenges vs. previous work.
For example,
RISC-V could in fact be viewed as {\em three} related base ISAs,
 RV32I~\cite[Section 2]{RV:ISA:I:19},
 RV64I~\cite[Section 5]{RV:ISA:I:19},
and
RV128I~\cite[Section 6]{RV:ISA:I:19},
that each support a different word size:
designing ISEs that are applicable (or scale) across these options is a
complicating factor.
We hope this work supports RISC-V in becoming the
first widely implemented ISA to support AES acceleration across
all implementation profiles, from embedded IoT devices to application
and server class processors.

Note that in order to satisfy the TCHES submission guidelines, we have 
anonymised various resources and references.  We intend to open-source 
such resources post-submission, but could provide them to reviewers, 
if required, to facilitate the review process.
